How to run the code?
# Python 3.7.3 is language used.
1. There is a server.py program, which is the http server. 
2. There is a root directory (\www\) with different file extensions.
3. Server program is created in such a way that, when server is running it will accept the request that is coming from the client (eg: chrome, firefox etc) and sends back the data, which will be displayed on client.
4. Command used to run server code in Command Prompt: >python -m http.server <portnumber>
5. URL used by client: http://localhost:<portnumber> and Directory is displayed to the client.
6. File path should be mentioned correctly to get the index.html page. (If directly requesting using URL by client)
